# goChat
A simple chat between multiple clients over sockets in golang.

## How to use?

Start the server first. For developement, using `go run Server/*.go` is recommended.

After the server is up and running, start as many clients as you want. To do that, do `go run Client/*.go <name>`. Replace `<name>` with your nickname. 

## Why?

I wanted to learn more about networking in Go.
